# Create VDC with Edge Portal API Demo

This is a website to demonstrate using the Portal APIs to provision a VDC with an Internet Edge Gateway.

Usage (Docker):

```bash
build_id="$(docker image build . | tee >(cat 1>&2) | tail -n1 | awk '{print $NF}')"

docker container run --rm -itp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 "$build_id"
# Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in a web browser.
# Open Developer Tools â†’ Network Inspector to inspect the requests and responses.
# Fill in and submit the form.
```
